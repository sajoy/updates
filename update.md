## prose
So. I've been thinking about values. I followed along with an exercise a few months ago and narrowed them down to five things:
1. Creativity 💡
1. Growth 🐛
1. Curiosity 🔮
1. Community 💪
1. Balance 💞

Before that (I don't remember how long ago), I thought about my "why":
> WHY: to celebrate life through curiosity and help other people cultivate their creativity

and also, a corresponding "what" and "how":
> WHAT/HOW: be curious & creative, create art, teach others how to create and that they are creative, share interesting lessons and learning opportunities

These past few weeks have been rough, for personal reasons. But because of that, I've spent a lot of time (way too much time) reflecting on myself and my life. And I revisited my values and narrowed them down to three:
1. Create 💡
1. Grow 🐛
1. Seek Balance 💞

These are the things I keep coming back to. Not so much creativity and whatever that word means, but literally the act of creating. Growing through self-reflection, through reading, because there is so much still to learn. Seeking balance because I think that's one of my biggest philosophies in life: balance in all things. For every good thing, there is something not good. For every up there is a down - you might not be the one who experiences both, but somewhere in the universe, there is something balancing out the energy in your life.

My values have also shifted into verbs, because I've realized living without intention isn't what I want. For the past couple of years, hell, possibly for all of my life, I've taken so much for granted. Mistakenly thinking that these things will be there tomorrow, or the chance to get them back in my life would always be there. And while that second part might be  true - it's not a reason to not enjoy what's in your life while you have it.

I'm tired of thinking. I'm itching to act. To get to the what and how of my why. To make decisions and choices intentionally pursuing my values and my ultimate goal in life: amazing, inspiring laugh lines (and also growing, creating, seeking balance and celebrating life and helping people cultivate their creativity).

Now what?


## miscellaneous
Not fear, not fear, not fear; but rather your hopes and wants, your abilities and talents. Your voice, shaky, but there and loud and expressive. Pain isn't bad. Pain isn't bad. It sucks to be alone, but it sucks way fucking worse to think your loneliness isn't a place to love yourself. It sucks worse to not make the call, to not let down your walls, to not be heart-breakingly honest.

## epiphanies
- Having a dishwasher doesn't make up for not having discipline.
- Happiness is living your life 1) intentionally 2) by your values.
