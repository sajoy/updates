## prose
At the mineral musuem there is a dark room with a display of rocks behind a glass window. The only lights are in the display. They switch between regular light and black light. In the light we're used to, the minerals look as you'd expect: shiny flecks, a range of colors from dirt brown to gray-purple to light tan to baby pink to weird pastel green. With the black light, the rocks reveal their incredible neon colors. The earthy tones are replaced with bright oranges, blues, greens, and a beautifully intense yellow.

On the dance floor, colorful lights swoop around the floor and up the walls, passing over the people moving their bodies to the music. With the lights on, they communicate with their voices, asking for time or attention or instructions. With the lights off, they use their bodies to tell their stories. The clichÃ© ones about healing broken hearts, the eerie ones about getting lost and never found, the gut twisting ones about betrayal, the heart warming ones about learning how to cook, the ones you want to hear over and over and over again, the ones you feel you weren't meant to hear.

By the fire at the house party, it's the smoke and the orange glow that transforms the people gathered around it. Transforms them from humans into planets: revolving around the hot flames and rotating around their own molten centers. We spin, letting our neighbors glance our haphazard patterns, our geography slowly shifting with time. In the daylight, we appear to be covered with cloth, but in the warm darkness, the cloth is revealed to be clouds and beneath them-our oceans hum, our mountains call to be explored, our minerals start to glow.

## miscellaneous
A cardboard box filled with gifts wrapped in red and gold, giant bows and ribbons raining glitter onto the floor. Swooning over the sounds of an alto saxaphone. A twenty dollar glass of Japanese whiskey. Spinning inside a tunnel of rainbow Christmas lights. A fizzy pink drink accidentally alcohol free. A shitty poem written in code. A growing collection of cropped sweaters. The sun, bright but cool, on your face as you cross the river each morning for a week. 


## epiphanies
- Ask to be heard. Ask if someone feels heard.
- Everything is an attempt to connect.
