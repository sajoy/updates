## prose
Tonight my Lyft driver told me she likes driving for Lyft because of the variety of people she gets to meet. She told me she realized that even though everyone is unique and different, there's something similar we all share. I didn't ask her what that something was-we'd quickly moved on to a new topic-but these are some things I think we have in common:
- the desire to know and understand
- the desire to express and connect
- the tendency to forget how complex people are, especially those we cherish
- the tendency to believe our thoughts and reactions instead of questioning them
- the capacity to grow

I desire to know and understand why people act the way they do, believe the things they believe, and want the things they want. I want to know how the world works, even if I could never fully understand. I desire to express my confusion, admiration, awe of the mundane and the interesting. I want to express happiness, sadness, frustration. I want to connect to that place in you that has no words, only movement, only an eruption of tears. I forget, constantly, that my husband's, mother's, father's, friend's day extends way past my consideration of it. I forget about all the strangers surrounding me and their spinning worlds. I believe my thoughts when they tell me I'm angry or hurt when really I'm scared. I neglect to question how I interpret the tension in my shoulders, the concentration of energy pushing in instead of flowing out. I look in the mirror and wonder how it's been seven years since x, three years since y, seventeen years since tiny me sat in a tree crawling with ants and covered in flecks of sunlight.

## miscellaneous
A fluffy, gray sky; a mirror river; a connect the dots spread of orange, yellow, white lights. White paint splatters decorating the top step of a ladder. A downpour right outside the window. Three tall, lanky men with long brown hair. A train car with a different seating layout. A forgotten phone charger. China plates with sticker scenes: sharks with sports gear, a cat at a dog's birthday party, pizza.

## epiphanies
- You're not ready. Do it anyways.
