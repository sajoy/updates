## prose
Maybe what I'm here for, is to write about love. Maybe I'm here to fill my life's quota of gray days. Maybe I'm here to witness your heartbreak. Maybe I'm here to be a conduit for something. Maybe I'm here to stumble over my words, struggle through my thoughts, suffocate from my memories. Maybe I'm here to revisit who and how and where I am but only every five years. Maybe I'm here to live in eras of 4 years. Maybe I'm here to shed my skin, leave little flecks of me you can't even see everywhere I go, fleeing rooms too full, businesses too empty. Maybe I'm here to be a cat hammock. Maybe I'm here to keep the bed warm. Maybe what I'm here for, is to replace the kitchen appliances one by one as they break. Maybe I'm here to let the sunlight filter through my eyelashes. Maybe I'm here too much.

I'm definitely not here to make sense. I'm not here to make you make sense. I'm not here to find one Truth, to coalesce us to peace. I'm not here to influence your beliefs. I'm not here to make definitive statements. I'm probably not here for the green green trees. I'm definitely not here for the cold, windy coast. I'm not here to make the perfect cup of coffee. I'm not here to fill the air with sweet songs. I'm probably not here intentionally, fully. I'm not here because I don't want to be there. 

I am here to create. I am here to pull from thin air. I am here to translate electricty into ideas. I am here to get warm. I am here to buy another tool for joy. I am here to feel the ground as I walk. I am here to imagine. I am here to daydream. I am here to stimulate. I am here to exist in my brain. I am here to exist in my body. I am here in hopes of finding a connection. I am here to sing along with my dog's howls. I am here to scribble on my walls. I am here to avoid doing my chores. I am here to listen. I am here to see. I am here to get lost. I am here to wonder. I am here to ask. I am here to be afraid. I am here to move forward. 

## miscellaneous
A conversation about memory at Wendy's. A conversation about compatibility while walking around QFC. A serendipitous conversation in preparation for a shocking one. A conversation on the way to the rose garden. A conversation with lighting and a backdrop. Fallen flowers, pink like crayons, folded like crepes. A beach, sideways rain, leading to a gallery of waves.

## epiphanies
- You (and your experiences) go in the direction you look.
- Big skills and talents and accomplishments are a cumulation of smaller (and learnable and practicable) skills.
- Self-compassion and kindness are vital to perseverance.
