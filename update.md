## prose
I didn't learn how to chop up a whole chicken, despite my mother telling me "and then, Saj, you cut here," her voice followed by the sound of bone cracking. Instead I'm contemplating the skin and structure of the carcass. The pink hues, the rippled texture, the similiarity in makeup to myself. Ribs. Neck. Breasts. Muscle. I help make our dinner by sautÃ©ing the ginger, onions, and tomatoes; turning down the heat, adding in the bloody chicken meat; watching the sizzling turn to steam, watching the pink skin turn speckled golden brown; drowning the ingredients in tap water; turning the exhaust fan to its highest setting.

I used to dislike cooking. I used to think it was a waste of time: nearly an hour cutting up food, cooking it in a pot, letting it cool before ever getting to consume anything, then consuming it in less than half the amount of time it took to create it. Not worth it. Not worth spending the energy stored in my brown flesh, pink tinged palms, bored muscles. But there was something else driving my dislike: I didn't know what I was doing. 

I asked my mom if she learned how to do this (take a bird apart with a knife) from Lola. She said no. Eventually, she remembered how she learned: a cooking show starring a Chinese man. She watched it when she first moved to the states.

I didn't learn how to chop up a whole chicken, despite my mother telling me. I did learn why people cook together. It's the process of creating, just like creating art or music or whatever, but condensed into a short time and intensified by the proximity to ingredients that tease the senses. The sight of a fleshy body being separated by shiny, sharp silver. The sound of body breaking. The feeling of heat from the stove. The billowing steam. The visual transformation from full, red tomato flesh to orange transluscentness.

Cooking is sometimes solely for the nourishment of our desperate-for-energy-body-parts. Other times, cooking is for providing energy and refreshment to our tired souls.

## miscellaneous
A cardboard box filled with gifts wrapped in red and gold, giant bows and ribbons raining glitter onto the floor. Swooning over the sounds of an alto saxaphone. A twenty dollar glass of Japanese whiskey. Spinning inside a tunnel of rainbow Christmas lights. A fizzy pink drink accidentally alcohol free. A shitty poem written in code. A growing collection of cropped sweaters. The sun, bright but cool, on your face as you cross the river each morning for a week.
