## prose
After getting through security at SFO, I caught a glimpse of a Burger King before I started walking towards my gate in the opposite direction. I debated grabbing a milkshake before walking, but figured I'd have another chance along the way. I didn't. Not until I reached the very end of the terminal where there was a Joe & The Juice tucked in the corner, against those tall airport windows.

I had a raspberry, banana, vanilla milkshake; sat down; disappeared into thought until I recognized that sweet, velvety voice singing profanities. Kid Cudi. I tell people I didn't  appreciate hip hop or rap until I moved to the whitest city in the country. But really, I fell in love with Kid Cudi's voice on the way there. I drove west with a best friendâ€”another friend had gifted her a mix cd with Pursuit of Happiness on itâ€”we played it on repeat til we had the lyrics memorized, driving through a desert in pitch black.

Listening to Kid Cudi being blasted in this little corner of the world, in between memories of driving across the country and getting to know new friends, I was flushing out this idea of version controlling my stories, my thoughts. The scribbles in my notebook started with "to create", underlined. They quickly moved through a directory structure, to potential headers/categories, to questions about github, to quick layout sketches, through a tangent about my aesthetics, to notes on a final layout, the last words being "randomized calm" and "randomized energy".

If you've stumbled across this and are wondering what this is... I don't know what to tell you. I can tell you: this isn't a blog. It's not going to be shareable or super easily digestable. It's not going to accumulate in the same way, but it will accumulate. For something new to be added, something old has to be removed. There won't be posts or categories; there will be additions and subtractions and commits and shifts in values, obsessions, thoughts.

This is an experiment confronting the same thing all my other experiments have and probably forever will: identity. What does it look like to share yourself in a context people aren't used to? What does it feel like to remember your past self before writing about your present self? What does it mean to learn about someone? Is it as easy as reading a nicely formatted blog? Is it as complex as digging through committed code? Does being confronted with a messy interface or interaction scare you away? Is it worth peeling back the layers we've accumulated, hell, is it worth admitting we have them?

## miscellaneous
SnapChat's cat filter, the full moon coinciding with full emotions, arriving just in time for dinner, thrifting with family, my new black and purple stripped dress, black nail polish, dragon's milk, animating your own damn California sunset.

## epiphanies
- Growing means being able to know two contradictory truths at once, to make space for both.
- You are meant to move.
