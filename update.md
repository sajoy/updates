## prose
Growing up you learn to associate the word "tree" with that towering entity of fluttering green and scratchy brown. Your brain repeats the pair over and over again until you stop asking the people around you: but why is that tree small? why does that tree have orange leaves? why does that tree have none?

In less than a century, we've made smaller and smaller transistors (a transistor amplifies or switches eletronic signals - gives us a sense of control). We went from an integrated circuit having a few thousand transistors to having over 7 billion, allowing us to make computers smaller, faster, better.

Growing up you learn to associate the word "love" with that towering entity of fluttering lashes and flushing cheeks. Your brain repeats the pair over and over again until you stop asking the people around you: but why do they hold hands? why do they have a look of longing in their eyes? why do they say those words as if they were salve.

See, associate, create a path, let the energy through, repeat. See, associate, create a path, let the energy through, repeat. See, associate, create a path, let the energy through, repeat. See, see, see. Associate. Create a path, create a new path, run down that path with a leaf blower, walk slowly down the path as if walking in a snowy forest. Let your energy through. Let your energy out. Repeat.

In less than a century, we've made habit of turning sand into silicon into microchips into data. We've made habit of seeking energy from the electricity of microchips instead of the sparks created when we forge a new path from this unfamiliar territory to this new understanding.

Growing up you learn to associate the word "fear" with that towering entity of shadow and that empty feeling of loss. Your brain repeats the pair over and over again until you stop asking the people around you: but will it hurt? but is pain bad? but can I endure?

Let the energy through. See the path. Associate. Repeat.

## miscellaneous
A fluffy, gray sky; a mirror river; a connect the dots spread of orange, yellow, white lights. White paint splatters decorating the top step of a ladder. A downpour right outside the window. Three tall, lanky men with long brown hair. A train car with a different seating layout. A forgotten phone charger. China plates with sticker scenes: sharks with sports gear, a cat at a dog's birthday party, pizza.

## epiphanies
- You're not ready. Do it anyways.
- Work takes time.
