## prose
My parent's house is a time capsule. Buried under uneven sidewalks, chalked-up asphalt, graduation banners hanging over garage doors, mulch, houses with shutters that don't shut. Inside it: all the crafts I made that involved or featured clouds, expired canned food, an open bottle of Lubrusco rolling around in the vegetable drawer, labeled kitchen cabinets, out of sync clocks, a cable box with no set favorites, so many thirsty plants.

My best friend's house is her best friend's. The guest room has no curtains and the Alexa in the kitchen has a screen and likes to tell jokes. Their cat is a playful baby you can convince to run up and down the stairs. We sit at the top of them, admiring the high walls they painted, talking about being exhausted.

My brother's house is full of dogs. Pictures, calendars, and live fluffy bodies herding each other on slick wood floors. We play video games downstairs on the giant beanbags, and again upstairs spread across the L-shaped couch and the dog-dotted floor. 

My best friend's house has a huge backyard with a creek that runs by. An unfinished basement and a weird corner kitchen sink. We have to move the bed from one spare room to another so I can close the door while I sleep. There are splotches of yellow and blue paint on one wall - to test how they look. We make chicken nuggets from scratch and watch Drunk History on the smaller monitor next to the bigger monitor.

My best friend's house is a blank slate. A connect-the-dots of inherited furniture. A graveyard of spiders. A wonderfully skylight lit hallway bathroom. An echo of an ex-best friend's house. The new party house, with a bar downstairs and a container half full of strawberry margarita in the fridge in the garage. A blue, velvety couch, and a long night fading into a hungry morning.

## miscellaneous
A conversation about memory at Wendy's. A conversation about compatibility while walking around QFC. A serendipitous conversation in preparation for a shocking one. A conversation on the way to the rose garden. A conversation with lighting and a backdrop. Fallen flowers, pink like crayons, folded like crepes. A beach, sideways rain, leading to a gallery of waves.

## epiphanies
- Everything is a want, not a need.
