## prose

There's a hole in the floor. This has happened before. You, buying a used vehicle, with a hole in the floor. I'm in the passenger seat, like usual. Only this time, I'm not the only woman you love. You used to tell me you thought no one else could love someone as gross as you. I always told you otherwise. Now, she rides shotgun with you occasionally, hope nestled in her heart that yours is tied only to hers. 

We're driving to the Waste Transfer Station, not a dump, because this is a city, not the suburban or rural space we grew up in. Your window won't roll up all the way. Later, after we return to the apartment, you'll realize your door won't latch properly anymore either. I'll wonder if you have an affinity for broken things because you think you're broken, too. 

The Waste Transfer Station is a warehouse with bay doors for cars and trucks to enter. It's like a drive-thru for dumping your garbage instead of buying it. We toss our mattress, folded in half and tied with tie-line. We toss the oversize pallets our moldy mattress sat on. We toss the bags of kitchen garbage that never made it to the curb.

The week leading up to your trip, you help her paint her bathoom. You play tennis with her cute little cousins. You spend time with her instead of packing your things. Instead of preparing your van that you'll live in for a month.

A few weeks after you leave, I deep clean the apartment, discover all the dents and scratches we left on the floors and doors and walls. I buy a Swiffer; scrub the painted concrete floor; scrub the bathtub; wipe down the front door dirtied with fingerprints; wipe the inside of the fridge as two guys from 1-800-GOT-JUNK haul out my old armchair, a pile of recycling, and a dozen bags of trash.

A few weeks after you leave, I spray water onto the concrete wall outside our front door, use a bright yellow microfiber towel to wipe away the chalk message I left for you. An attempt to make you see, to confront you, to overwhelm you, to remind you of the time you felt so much for me you couldn't sleep, and instead drove to my house in the middle of the night to leave me your thoughts scrawled in words that got smaller and smaller as you ran out of room.


## miscellaneous
A wall of lotus blossoms, painted white on black, clothes-pinned to string; a beach turned whimsical playground - smooth gray stones under a jungle gym of white fallen tree trunks; a slug slow morning; a week of sleepless nights; opening a book of letters to the most relevant one, questioning how to accept a sad, sad truth; the moon light on the water behind you, the sunset coloring the water behind me; a new denim dress; a growing pile of donations; an echoing bedroom; alligator bites, a foil seahorse, a foil fox, a foil mouse; an archived conversation; a too romantic suggestion; a craving for breadsticks; a craving to be touched. 

## epiphanies
- You get better sleep alone.
- Even with a better fitting bike, you have to pedal to go fast.
