## prose
At the beginning of the workshop we had a conversation about being aggressive. We talked about how we felt when we felt angry or aggressive, and how we felt when other people are angry or aggressive towards us. We went around our circle, mostly agreeing with each other about suppressing anger, not really ever being aggressive, and trying to get away from or avoid people angry or aggressive with us. I said my aggression usually ends up turning into movement: angry and cathartic dancing, running even though I don't run. This is the other definition of aggression: energy rather than hostility.

I danced (ballet, lyrical, etc) growing up. People called me graceful, called my movement fluid. When I think about aggression as energy I think about something my movement lacked. Power. Intensity. Aggression. Controlled, rerouted, transformed from something that evokes pain into something that invokes catharsis through restraint. To release energy, you must first hoard it.

At the end of the workshop half of the class formed a tunnel two people wide, standing shoulder to shoulder, each pair held punching pads flush against each other. The other half of the class lined up to run, push, struggle, force our way through. At the end, there was one more pad for us to absolutely attack. Each woman's name was asked and announced before she started. Each woman's name was cheered and yelled amidst "YOU GOT THIS" and "YES" and "GO, GO, GO".

There is something about a dancer's movement that makes rehearsed phrases feel authentic and not at all performative. That something is energy. It's thinking of your body as something to be moved by energy - not thinking of your body as something to be perceived. It's letting your energy exert itself, take up the space it needs, instead of trying to be quiet and small. I thought I would be self-concious running, pushing my way through the tunnel. I wasn't. I was energy, releasing, a force pushing back at the forces pushing against me.


## miscellaneous
There are no merry-go-rounds to fall off of, but there are swings to crash and sticks to throw spinning into the air; whenever I think of her it feels like a dream, like revisiting an old me; making hard decisions should be about following your values and shaping yourself - not choosing which is better; I fall in love so easily over jokes meant to be taken seriously.
