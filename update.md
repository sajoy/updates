## prose
Is it too late to add to this? I just made a BearBlog and I think I love it, but when I opened this up to link to it from there, I fell in love again again again. This isn't the platform for sharing personal thoughts like this, but I think that's why I love it. This isn't the platform for browsing long form writing, but I think that's why I love it. This isn't the platform for me in the sense that I haven't touched it in literally years, but maybe that's why I fell in love again. Nostalgia. Revisiting my past self and feeling gratitude for her thoughts, for her sharing, for her weird idea to share her thoughts in this way. This way that requires erasing of old text, old thoughts, to replace them with new ones. 

Is it too late to be what I want to be? Oh, no, lmao, the answer is absolutely no. There are lists somewhere out there of all the people who didn't start their successful careers til my age and later. It's not too late, I'm not even going to entertain that idea. Ideas I will entertain: everything will happen as it's meant to; I will find the people I'm meant to; I will create exactly what I'm meant to create; I'm lucky and things work out for me. Ideas I will entertain: I can do things even if I start off not knowing how; momentum and perseverance matter more than I want to give them credit for; one thought in front of the other; rest is a prerequisite for getting shit done.

Is it the right time? Yes.

## epiphanies
- You (and your experiences) go in the direction you look.
- Big skills and talents and accomplishments are a cumulation of smaller (and learnable and practicable) skills.
- Self-compassion and kindness are vital to perseverance.
