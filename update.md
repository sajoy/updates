## prose
*The blurry river*

The one thing I tell people I miss about my hometown: the Rappahannock River. Its perfect depth for wading and swimming. Its dangerous reputation. The view of it from the bridge home. Three thousand miles from home, brown water is flowing over the skin of strangers. Three thousand miles from home is the memory of sitting on a rock, absorbing sun, sticking leaves on our foreheads, silly and strange enough.

*The mad ocean*

I lie back and close my eyes and reopen them and see a gray sky as blue. I hear the ocean crash into itself. I hear a seagull ask for friendship. One hundred miles from home. My blanket is red and there is a little black speck floating around my right eye. When I stare too long at the blue gray clouded sky it starts to rotate like a kaleidoscope.

*The dead fountain*

A mile away from home, a garden of roses surrounds a stilled fountain. Above, a gazebo of couples dancing. The bottom of the fountain is visible, concrete, unhappy. The water is stagnant until a Dachshund and its owner disobey the posted rule and wade around. Even the bright blue sky's reflection is dimmed by the gray water, gray concrete. Pinks and reds and whites and greens and purples and oranges and yellows swirl around it: roses in bloom, rose petals fallen to the ground, grass, leaves, thorns.

## miscellaneous
Pink roses with pinked petals; pink starbursts; the printed sign behind the cash register: we encourage random dancing; a promise to love etched into the pier; a promise of existence scratched into dark sand; hoof prints racing down the hill; a deer leaping over the wire fence between humans and cliff; a rainbow paraglider; a man running in the sand; a man running with a box of leis in hand; a thank you for not shaving; "hang tight".

## epiphanies
- Enjoy being.
