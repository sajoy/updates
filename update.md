## prose
So. I've been thinking about values. I followed along with an exercise a few months ago and narrowed them down to five things:
1. Creativity üí°
1. Growth üêõ
1. Curiosity üîÆ
1. Community üí™
1. Balance üíû

Before that (I don't remember how long ago), I thought about my "why":
> WHY: to celebrate life through curiosity and help other people cultivate their creativity

and also, a corresponding "what" and "how":
> WHAT/HOW: be curious & creative, create art, teach others how to create and that they are creative, share interesting lessons and learning opportunities

These past few weeks have been rough, for personal reasons. But because of that, I've spent a lot of time (way too much time) reflecting on myself and my life. And I revisited my values and narrowed them down to three:
1. Create üí°
1. Grow üêõ
1. Seek Balance üíû

These are the things I keep coming back to. Not so much creativity and whatever that word means, but literally the act of creating. Growing through self-reflection, through reading, because there is so much still to learn. Seeking balance because I think that's one of my biggest philosophies in life: balance in all things. For every good thing, there is something not good. For every up there is a down - you might not be the one who experiences both, but somewhere in the universe, there is something balancing out the energy in your life.

My values have also shifted into verbs, because I've realized living without intention isn't what I want. For the past couple of years, hell, possibly for all of my life, I've taken so much for granted. Mistakenly thinking that these things will be there tomorrow, or the chance to get them back in my life would always be there. And while that second part might be  true - it's not a reason to not enjoy what's in your life while you have it.

I'm tired of thinking. I'm itching to act. To get to the what and how of my why. To make decisions and choices intentionally pursuing my values and my ultimate goal in life: amazing, inspiring laugh lines (and also growing, creating, seeking balance and celebrating life and helping people cultivate their creativity).

Now what?


## miscellaneous
Career advice from your lyft driver: trust the timing of your life, trust yourself. A gold fly on the wall. Confusion as preperation for receptiveness. A note from a stranger with a quiet voice, acknowledgement. Trying to patch the future by reviving the past. How we select the stories we let define us, and if you change those, will you be a whole new person? Give everything and fail. Give everything and fail. You regret what you don't do. These are getting too cliche. The blue condom wrapper on the steps. The raccoon with its arched back blocking my way. The sticker you have to stare at before seeing the eye staring back at you. The city behind it. The distance you know you need to create. Turning the car around to chase the coyote through the neighborhood into the park. It's cute how you fall asleep in the car. I like it, too.

## epiphanies
- Happiness is living your life 1) intentionally 2) by your values.
- It's okay to fuck up, but you have to 1) own up 2) take action to make things right.
- Have gratitude for yourself.
