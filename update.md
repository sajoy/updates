## prose
There is more than just expectation versus reality. There is an in between, a constant state of daydream. The expectation is that she'd never want to re-enter your life. The reality is that she thinks of you as often as you think of her. The daydream is that she aches when you ache, the universe still ties you together, she remembers your voices entwining, you swooning as she sang.

There is more than repetition and variation. There is an in between, a constant state of revisiting. The repetition is your desire to be daring and doing by association. The variation is he loved indie music and he loves house. The revisiting is their obsession with music you cannot touch. The repetition is them growing bored and you blaming yourself. The variation is you learning to be vulnerable. The revisiting is you skittish with insecurity.

There is more than fear and love. There is an in between, a constant state of wanting. The fear is deflecting the question by asking your own. The love is sitting on the floor, hurting, confused, but present. The wanting is saying thank you, thank you, thank you.

There is more than learning and losing. There is a constant state of choosing. The choosing to be present. The choosing to express the love and desire and fear and arrogance and pain inside you. The choosing to stay. The choosing to take care of yourself. The choosing to listen without trying to think of what to say. The choosing to leave. The choosing to stay. 

## miscellaneous
A wall of lotus blossoms, painted white on black, clothes-pinned to string; a beach turned whimsical playground - smooth gray stones under a jungle gym of white fallen tree trunks; a slug slow morning; a week of sleepless nights; opening a book of letters to the most relevant one, questioning how to accept a sad, sad truth; the moon light on the water behind you, the sunset coloring the water behind me; a new denim dress; a growing pile of donations; an echoing bedroom; alligator bites, a foil seahorse, a foil fox, a foil mouse; an archived conversation; a too romantic suggestion; a craving for breadsticks; a craving to be touched.

- You get better sleep alone.
- Even with a better fitting bike, you have to pedal to go fast.
