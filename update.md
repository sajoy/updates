## prose
A while ago I spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of work I wanted to do and why-in other words what my values are and what kind of work they drive me to do. Now, finding myself without a job, I want to spend some time thinking about when I thrive. I know what kind of work I want to do: I want to help create products that enable and encourage other people to create. Create what? Honestly, pretty much anything expressive. Websites, writing, art, podcast, videos, etc. So in addition to publishing platforms, I'm also invested in productivity apps, and learning apps, basically anything that helps people make and do. How do I want to help? I enjoy being part of the creative process: ideating, designing, and developing. I think I also have a growing ability to help other people learn and grow. Which just so happen to be part of my own core values: growth, creativity, and balance.

The interviewing process with various companies has been pretty exhausting, but it's also kind of fun to get to know different companies, their values, and how they work. I think it's really important to treat the interview process as a two-way conversation; they need to know if I'd be a good fit, and I need to know if they're a place I want to work at. We both want to figure out if I would thrive. That's why I want to figure out when I have in the past, so I know what to look for and ask about.

I thrive...

1. With a system of accountability

After college I spent a few months as a social media intern at a local bowling alley. While I was there I would send an email at the end of the week to my boss and her boss. It would detail the things I'd accomplished that week as well as the latest statistics for our social media accounts. Writing that email served as a really nice way to wrap up the week, feel good about what I had accomplished, and know where I needed to focus on the following week. It's something I wish I'd kept doing these past two years, and is definitely something I plan on doing in my next position. Of course, a lot of tech companies have daily stand ups or something equivalent where they talk about what they did, but I think having some kind of documentation per week sent to my manager or even just kept somewhere for myself would be incredibly beneficial.

2. Late at night

Maybe not the healthiest method of productivity-but I've often found that I'm incredibly creative and productive from 10pm-3am. Throughout school I definitely worked late into the night and even pulled a couple all-nighters to finish work due the next day. However, there were also times when I worked into the early morning because I'd reached that wonderful state of flow. I know some remote companies advocate for working whenever is best for you. I don't think it's a sustainable schedule; I'd probably reserve working that late when I felt stuck or needed extra focus time. But having the option of working late at night instead of normal work hours (ideally not in addition to) would be great.

3. During thunderstorms

This is only kind of a serious one. Back home we would have great, big thunderstorms during which I usually found myself being incredibly productive. There are approximately 0 thunderstorms where I am now, so I'll have to think of something else to inspire that feeling of looming anticipation and catharsis. The ocean, maybe?

4. With someone to pair program with

While working at Cardsmith, I pair programmed pretty much full-time with the other developer on our team while he was with us. I think pairing helps me thrive a lot. It's easier to stay focused and on track-there are no distraction breaks. It also makes programming and sitting at your computer a lot more enjoyable because you're still socializing with another human. It's definitely a challenge, but when done properly, with both people contributing to typing and talking and everything as equally as possible, I think it works really well. I'm an introvert by design, but I find that when I'm working with someone towards a goal, I enjoy the work and the time spent with them more.

5. With a repetitive playlist

So I think this one and the one about thunderstorms are more about the immediate environment I'm in. It's an environment in which it's easy to focus. What makes it easy for me to focus? Repetitive music helps (the same song over and over and over again, or the same playlist or album, or similar music). As does the somberness of a thunderstorm (not to mention the repetitive sound of pouring rain). I also think having an organized system helps, for example, structuring my text editor, browser showing what I'm working on, and browser for doing research in the same way every time I work. Similarly, I think the visuals of my surroundings (both physical and virtual) make a big difference. One of the reasons why I'm eager to work remotely-I'll have more say in what my work environment is. Being surrounded by a mess is distracting and stressing. Having things neat and visually appealing around me helps me keep calm and centered. I think there's something about predictability here. The songs I listen to while working tend to be songs I'm already deeply familiar with. Being organized and having a structure for my work space means I don't spend extra time or energy finding things.

6. With clear expectations

Whether I set them myself, or they're given to me, I've learned I need a clear set of tasks or goals defined for me. So far this is the only thing on my list that is inspired by my failure to thrive, rather than success. I think my failure in the past was not knowing how to ask for clear expectations, and not creating them for myself. There have been times where I've had ideas and the freedom to execute them, but minimal explicit external validation around what was expected of me. I think that lack of external validation has thrown me in the past-I'm wasn't sure if they really want me to do the thing because they didn't completely buy into it. Or I didn't trust myself and my ideas enough to follow through with them on my own, regardless of the lack of expectation. Working on side projects has helped this. I think writing more publicly intended things will help. I don't want to be micromanaged, but knowing the end goal in addition to the direction I should be going in is super helpful, as is validation that I'm heading there. This whole paragraph might actually be about validation.

7. With respect

Here's another need derived from an experience where I didn't thrive. I need to be respected as a human. It's incredibly hard to do your best work when you're doing additional work of trying to prove yourself. Or even if you're not doing the extra work to prove yourself, you're probably doing extra emotional work to try and not be affected by the subliminal effects of working with someone who doesn't see your value. The occasional skeptical look is manageable and expected. A perpetual one is probably a biased one. I have no idea how you screen a company for this. Ask them point blank what they think about something potentially difficult to talk about? Ask for an example of a time they witnessed bias and what they did in response? Or ask how they combat it? What they themselves and their team consciously do to fight their unconscious bias? I've thought about asking other URM on the team for their experience and thoughts, but I think it might be more valuable to ask people who tend to be the culprits rather than victims.

## miscellaneous
A conversation about memory at Wendy's. A conversation about compatibility while walking around QFC. A serendipitous conversation in preparation for a shocking one. A conversation on the way to the rose garden. A conversation with lighting and a backdrop. Fallen flowers, pink like crayons, folded like crepes. A beach, sideways rain, leading to a gallery of waves.
