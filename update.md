## prose
My identity expressed as posessions: a DIY-ed button turned magnet with Regina Spektor lyrics ("aching to pupate") and a butterfly sticker; a swivel armchair with a pink, purple, green oversized floral pattern; a silver cuff bracelet with the text "LOVE YOURSELF"; a silver charm bracelet with symbols from various religions; a royal blue cell phone and bluetooth speaker and wallet and dress; gray flannel bed sheets; a collection of books with yellow on their covers; hand-sewn floral print pillow cases; a photo taped to the window with the picture facing out and words written on the back, "set up a life you don't need to escape from"; 

My identity expressed as arrangement of and proximity between posessions: aprons hanging on a hook near but not right next to the stove; full-length mirrors to the left of the closet; trash cans underneath the sinks; tools (measuring tape, screwdrivers, hooks, extra lightbulbs) in the bottom drawer of the craft storage; unused magnet poetry words arranged alphabetically on the fridge door; hanging clothes in a repeated pattern (black, gray, browns and neutrals, purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, pink); a desk hutch at the foot of the bed;

My identity expressed as forgotten bookmarks in my browser: "The Coming Software Apocolypse", "define stability", "Do Good Grades Predict Success?", "PostSecret", "I Don't Know What To Do With My Life!", "Akazukin Cha Cha episode 2 English Sub", "Taking imagination seriously", "Cut Out + Keep", "APIs Are Not Web Pages", "How Anthony Bourdain Slays His Lazy Inner Hippie Every Morning", "6 Destructive Ideas Perpetuated in Western Culture", "The Complete Guide to Building Your Personal Brand", "Making Art with Code with Emily Xie", "Creating a Weekly Research Cadence";

## miscellaneous
A conversation about memory at Wendy's. A conversation about compatibility while walking around QFC. A serendipitous conversation in preparation for a shocking one. A conversation on the way to the rose garden. A conversation with lighting and a backdrop. Fallen flowers, pink like crayons, folded like crepes. A beach, sideways rain, leading to a gallery of waves. 

## epiphanies
- There's a (complicated, fallible, ever-evolving) human on the other side.
