## prose
*The blurry river*

The one thing I tell people I miss about my hometown: the Rappahannock River. Its perfect depth for wading and swimming. Its dangerous reputation. The view of it from the bridge home. Three thousand miles from home, brown water is flowing over the skin of strangers. Three thousand miles from home is the memory of sitting on a rock, absorbing sun, sticking leaves on our foreheads, silly and strange enough.

*The mad ocean*

I lie back and close my eyes and reopen them and see a gray sky as blue. I hear the ocean crash into itself. I hear a seagull ask for friendship. One hundred miles from home. My blanket is red and there is a little black speck floating around my right eye. When I stare too long at the blue gray clouded sky it starts to rotate like a kaleidoscope.

*The dead fountain*

A mile away from home, a garden of roses surrounds a stilled fountain. Above, a gazebo of couples dancing. The bottom of the fountain is visible, concrete, unhappy. The water is stagnant until a Dachshund and its owner disobey the posted rule and wade around. Even the bright blue sky's reflection is dimmed by the gray water, gray concrete. Pinks and reds and whites and greens and purples and oranges and yellows swirl around it: roses in bloom, rose petals fallen to the ground, grass, leaves, thorns.

## miscellaneous
The lowered tone of absolute sadness, sitting in the doorway, sitting at the kid's table, a found polaroid: a wall of skulls, a dozen takes for a jumping picture, three visits to the ice cream shop in two days, a shitty makeshift couch more comfortable than your bed, a last minute scavenger hunt, sincerity in opposition versus agreeing with insincerity, seeing the big decision reflected in all the little decisions, cutting a mango the wrong way, a sign separating the surfers from the swimmers, a big rope basket, a thunderstorm to scare away the crowds, turning the boat around to avoid the storm, a free polaroid: lifting off into the sky, a gifted polaroid: holding hands, leaning outwards for balance, overexposed.

## epiphanies
- You get better sleep alone.
- Even with a better fitting bike, you have to pedal to go fast.
